# Customer_behavior_Analysis-Project

## Overview
Data Analysis project showcasing customer behavior analysis using Python, SQL and Power BI, starting from data loading and cleaning to analysis, visualization,
and business reporting. The objective is to extract meaningful insights from raw data using Python and SQL, and present the findings 
through an interactive Power BI dashboard and a structured business report.

---

## Dataset
- The dataset contains structured transactional/customer-related data.
- Data was loaded and explored using Python.
- Cleaning steps were applied to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues.
- Final cleaned data was stored and queried using a MySQL database.
